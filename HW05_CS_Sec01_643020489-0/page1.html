        <h3>1. Slow loading time</h3>
        <p><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/">According to surveys done by
                Akamai and Gomez.com,</a>
            <span>47% of the web users expect web page to load in 2 seconds</span>
            or less and <span> 40% of people abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load.</span>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Walmart Found for every 1 second of improvement in loading speed they experienced up to 2% increase in
            conversions.</p>
        <a target="_blank" href="./img/Loading-speed.png"><img style="padding: 3% 18%;" src="./img/Loading-speed.png"
                alt="graph"></a>

        <p>There are numerous reasons that can increase your website loading time. I will outline some of the common
            reasons here:
        <ul>
            <li>Using too many plugins</li>
            <li>Excessive use of flash</li>
            <li>Broken links</li>
            <li>Bad coding</li>
            <li>Images are too big in size</li>
        </ul>
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Many techniques, both from a design and coding aspect can be applied to your website for faster loading.
            Some of
            the techniques are given below-
        <ul>
            <li>Don't use too many plugins</li>
            <li>Optimize your images</li>
            <li>Reduce server response time</li>
            <li>Minimize HTTP Requests</li>
            <li>Reduce redirects</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="content2" class="container">
        <h3>2. Not Having a Prominent Call to Action (CTA)</h3>
        <p>One of the must have elements in your website for conversion is the call to action button. <span>No one is
                going to
                take action</span> (e.g. sign-up for a mailing list, make a purchase, request a quote, or simply call
            you) <span>if you
                don't ask them to do so.</span> </p>
        <br>
        <p>You have to make it clear to your visitors what you want them to do. Lack of prominent call to action button
            on a website wastes chance of turning visitors into leads, subscribers and customers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Just take a look at the below screenshot and it has no clear CTA button. There is a weak one at the bottom
            but the color of the button and the background color is exactly same. Therefore, the CTA button can easily
            be overlooked by the visitors.</p>
        <a target="_blank" href="./img/No-clear-CTA-button.png"><img style="padding: 3% 8%;"
                src="./img/No-clear-CTA-button.png" alt="example of no clear button"></a>
        <p>Here are the few things you need consider to craft a winning CTA-
        <ul>
            <li>Your CTA button color must be contrasting</li>
            <li>The button text should explain what will happen after clicking</li>
            <li>You need to include the button in right place so that people can see that easily</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="content3" class="container">
        <h3>3. Using the weak or common image</h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/"><img width="60%" style="padding: 3% 20%;"
                src="./img/weak_image.png" alt="example of website that uses image not meaningful and weak"></a>
        <p> <span>Images are one of the important and eye-catching design elements on a website.</span> I believe we all
            know that an
            image is worth a thousand words.</p><br>
        <p>The above statement is appropriate if your website images are meaningful, relevant, high quality and
            authentic.</p><br>
        <p>If you use the images that can be found on hundreds of other websites, then they may work negatively. Using
            the stock images undermine your credibility. Just say no to stock images.
        </p><br>
        <p><span>Make sure every image on your website is relevant, meaningful and of course high quality.</span> They
            should serve
            a purpose like pushing the visitors toward the conversion goal.</p>

    <div id="content4" class="container">
        <h3>4. Not being mobile friendly</h3>
        <p>In the middle of 2016, you can't afford to ignore the responsiveness. Human behavior has changed
            significantly and people are using smartphones and tablets on the go, in their beds, even in the bathrooms.
        </p><br>
        <p> <span>As now-a-days lots of people are using smartphones and tablets for browsing websites </span> and if
            your website is
            not mobile friendly then they will find your website broken when they will try to visit.
        </p>
        <a target="_blank" href="./img/responsive-design.png"><img width="70%" style="padding: 3% 14%;"
                src="./img/responsive-design.png" alt="responsive deisgn"></a>
        <p>Not having a responsive design can cause the loss of traffic as well as potential customers to your site.
            You need to ensure that your website is designed to accommodate all visitors regardless of the type of
            devices that people are using when visiting.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="content5" class="container">
        <h3>5. Confusing navigation</h3>
        <p>You website navigation play a major role to convert the visitors into leads, subscribers or customers.
            <span>Having
                too many options can paralyze the visitors to take any action</span> and will frustrate them that will
            eventually end up in abandoning your website.</p><br>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elegantseagulls.com/"><img width="60%" style="padding: 3% 18%;"
                src="./img/good Navigation Websites.png" alt="mockup"></a>
        <p>If your website has a clear navigation, your audience should effortlessly find their way towards your desired
            action.</p><br>
        <p>Therefore, the navigation of your website should be easy for the visitors to find what they are looking for.
            Otherwise, they will rapidly take the exit route and probably never come back to your website again.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="content6" class="container">
        <h3>6. Not Updating The Site</h3>
        <p>Nobody likes a website that is boring and dull or one that seems like it has not been updated in 5 years.
            When the visitors come to a site that appears dated, they immediately think that this company does not keep
            up with modern times. Or, even bad, they may also think this company is no longer in business.</p><br>
        <p> <span>When people come to an old looking website, most of them just click away as fast as possible</span>
            and they will
            probably move on to your competitor's site.

            As a general rule, I recommend people that they should consider updating or refreshing their websites in
            every 2 to 3 years.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="content7" class="container">
        <h3>7. Poor Use of Color</h3>
        <p>Colors play a crucial role in web design. <span>They help to highlight the buttons and links, make your site
                visually-appealing</span> and even increase the customer's overall web experience.</p><br>
        <p> At the same time using the wrong color or too many colors can confuse the visitors.</p><br>
        <p> Having the deep knowledge of color phycology is important to pick the right color for your website. Let me
            show you some of the colors associated feelings they typically convey:</p>
        <a target="_blank" href="./img/color and emotion.png"><img style="padding: 3% 4%;"
                src="./img/color and emotion.png" alt="color and emotion"></a>
    </div>

    <div id="content8" class="container">
        <h3>8. using too many plugins</h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://torquemag.io/2018/02/wordpress-plugins-many-many/"><img
                style="padding: 3% 18%;" width="70%" src="./img/loading_speed_40.png" alt="loading speeed"></a>
        <p>Plugins help to introduce new features to the website. But, <span>using too many plugins can increase your
                website
                loading time.</span> I already have discussed the consequence of slow loading speed.
        </p><br>
        <p>Sometimes people try to use different plugins into their websites just because they can, not because they
            really need to have them.</p><br>
        <p> Make sure you <span>don't use any extraneous stuff unless you must need it and only use the plugins</span>
            if they are
            really needed to make your site functional.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="content9" class="container" style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
        <h3>9. Unreadable texts</h3>
        <p>As much as images and videos dominate the content, text still plays a major role in compelling people to stay
            on your website.
        </p><br>
        <p> In spite of knowing that some websites have the habit of putting up oddly shaped fonts that are very hard to
            read. <span>If people can't read your copy easily then how people will take your desired action.</span> </p>
        <a target="_blank" href="./img/unreadable-text.png"><img width="70%" style="padding: 3% 15%;"
                src="./img/unreadable-text.png" alt="unreadable text"></a>
        <p>Here's how you can make your copy more readable
        <ul>
            <li>Use font size 16px or more</li>
            <li>Choosing legible font styles</li>
            <li>The formula for line height is 1.6 * the font size</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
